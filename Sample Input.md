Suppose we have the following directed graph with 5 vertices and 7 weighted edges:


Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

Edges:
(0 -> 1, Weight: 2)
(0 -> 2, Weight: 1)
(1 -> 3, Weight: 3)
(2 -> 3, Weight: 2)
(3 -> 4, Weight: 1)
(4 -> 0, Weight: 4)
(1 -> 2, Weight: -1)  // Negative weight edge
Source vertex: 0
Target vertex: 4
