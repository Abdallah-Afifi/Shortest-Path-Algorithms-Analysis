General Conclusion:

Dijkstra's Algorithm:

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from vertex 0 to 4, which is 4.
It does not detect the negative weight edge, but it provides a valid shortest path result.
The time taken (X microseconds) is relatively longer compared to the other two algorithms because it explores all nodes.
Bellman-Ford Algorithm:

Bellman-Ford algorithm correctly detects the negative weight edge (1 -> 2 with weight -1) and reports "Negative cycle detected."
It doesn't provide a valid shortest path in the presence of negative cycles.
The time taken is relatively shorter (Y microseconds) because it has to explore fewer nodes before detecting the negative cycle.
A Algorithm*:

A* algorithm finds the shortest path from vertex 0 to 4, which is 4.
It efficiently combines heuristic information (if applicable) with actual edge weights to find the shortest path.
The time taken (Y microseconds) is relatively short because it uses heuristics to guide the search.
In this particular example, A* and Dijkstra's algorithms correctly find the shortest path from vertex 0 to 4, while Bellman-Ford detects the negative cycle. The choice of which algorithm to use depends on the specific characteristics of your problem and the graph you are working with. If you know that your graph doesn't contain negative cycles, Dijkstra's algorithm or A* may be more efficient. If negative cycles are a possibility, Bellman-Ford should be used to detect them.
